# Everyone playing Outer Wilds in the same universe at different times!

## Harnessing the power of the Ash Twin Project I have managed to pluck hearthians from all different timelines into a singular, ~~buggier~~ universe!

Essentially everyone is playing through their own loop, and broadcasting their positions and chat to each other to simulate a multiplayer experience.
In the future I plan to sync certain things, such as rafts. Things to have fun with together!

Once the mod is downloaded, press the CONNECT TO SERVER button and you should load into the multiplayer game.

Any questions? Feel free to ping me on the Outer Wilds Discord - @Vesper

Thanks for reading and I hope you have fun!
